If you need to create a platform specific folder using Phonegap, please do the following:\
1) First, run the 'echo PATH=$PATH:/Users/francislawrence/Programming/phonegap-2.9.1/lib/<specific_platform>/bin' command.\
2) Then, you need to change your working directory to the bin of that platform in that same phonegap folder.\
3) Then, run the 'create name com.example.name Name' command.\
\
Also, if you need to change any of these settings, go to your home directory (~) and type \'91nano .bash_profile\'92.\
\
Also, if you need to do the EMULATE command, you have to go to the app folder and then run \'91ripple emulate\'92.\
\
To edit the tab control thing, go to nano .inputrc from your root directory.\
To substitute something in the previous line, type something like this... ^toreplace^touse\
To search previous lines, use Ctrl-R.\
To leave that screen you can get stuck in, use q when the END is highlighted.\
To learn the escape characters of buttons, first type ^V\
Jump to start of line ^A\
Jump to end of line ^E\
Clear text onward ^K\
Clear backward by word ^W\
Toggle between current cursor position and start of line ^XX\
Clear whole line ^U\
Bring last line back ^Y\
Search previous lines ^R\
! preceding starting character, Enter invokes last command\
To modify the last command, type !<firstfewcharacters>:s/<toreplace>/<desired>\
Keep Mac awake: $ caffeinate -u -t 600 (add options to set timer)\

\f0\b0 \cf1  I have instructions for the codebreaker!\
Welcome!\
Try to guess your opponent's code within the maximum number of rounds.\
To do this, enter your guess without any additional spacing or punctuation, when prompted.\
Maximum rounds: 12.\
Code length: 4\
Your options are: 
\f1\b \cf4 R
\f0\b0 \cf1 , 
\f1\b \cf5 B

	Your opponent will respond to you without regard to order.\
	They will give you a 2 for each correct letter in the correct place.\
	They will give you a 1 for each additional correct letter.\
	And they will give you a 0 for each additional letter.\
Is everything clear?\
