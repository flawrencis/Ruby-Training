If you need to create a platform specific folder using Phonegap, please do the following:\
1) First, run the 'echo PATH=$PATH:/Users/francislawrence/Programming/phonegap-2.9.1/lib/<specific_platform>/bin' command.\
2) Then, you need to change your working directory to the bin of that platform in that same phonegap folder.\
3) Then, run the 'create name com.example.name Name' command.\
\
Also, if you need to change any of these settings, go to your home directory (~) and type \'91nano .bash_profile\'92.\
\
Also, if you need to do the EMULATE command, you have to go to the app folder and then run \'91ripple emulate\'92.\
\
To edit irb ish, use the bash command 'nano ~/.inputrc'.\
To substitute something in the previous line, type something like this... ^toreplace^touse\
To search previous lines, use Ctrl-R.\
To leave that screen you can get stuck in, use q when the END is highlighted.\
To learn the escape characters of buttons, first type ^V\
Jump to start of line ^A\
Jump to end of line ^E\
Clear text onward ^K\
Clear backward by word ^W\
Toggle between current cursor position and start of line ^XX\
Clear whole line ^U\
Bring last line back ^Y\
Search previous lines ^R\
! preceding starting character, Enter invokes last command\
To modify the last command, type !<firstfewcharacters>:s/<toreplace>/<desired>\
Keep Mac awake: $ caffeinate -u -t 600 (add options to set timer)\
