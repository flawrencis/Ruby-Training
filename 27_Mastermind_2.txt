If you need to create a platform specific folder using Phonegap, please do the following:
1) First, run the 'echo PATH=$PATH:/Users/francislawrence/Programming/phonegap-2.9.1/lib/<specific_platform>/bin' command.
2) Then, you need to change your working directory to the bin of that platform in that same phonegap folder.
3) Then, run the 'create name com.example.name Name' command.

Also, if you need to change any of these settings, go to your home directory (~) and type ‘nano .bash_profile’.

Also, if you need to do the EMULATE command, you have to go to the app folder and then run ‘ripple emulate’.

To edit the tab control thing, go to nano .inputrc from your root directory.
To substitute something in the previous line, type something like this... ^toreplace^touse
To search previous lines, use Ctrl-R.
To leave that screen you can get stuck in, use q when the END is highlighted.
To learn the escape characters of buttons, first type ^V
Jump to start of line ^A
Jump to end of line ^E
Clear text onward ^K
Clear backward by word ^W
Toggle between current cursor position and start of line ^XX
Clear whole line ^U
Bring last line back ^Y
Search previous lines ^R
! preceding starting character, Enter invokes last command
To modify the last command, type !<firstfewcharacters>:s/<toreplace>/<desired>
Keep Mac awake: $ caffeinate -u -t 600 (add options to set timer)

I just brought player_two into my method. It is {:user_name=>"fakebake", :real_name=>"Bake Fake", :role=>"BREAKER"}.

Meanwhile, first_hash is {:user_name=>"shakjake", :real_name=>"Jake Shake", :role=>"BREAKER"}.
I've just changed player two's hash to MAKER. See for yourself : {:user_name=>"fakebake", :real_name=>"Bake Fake", :role=>"MAKER"}.
Now that we've finished a_d, the player_hash is .

Right now, the player_hash is {:user_name=>"reddjust", :real_name=>"Justin Redd", :role=>"MAKER"}. Let's call already_decided.
I just brought player_two into my method. It is {:user_name=>"reddjust", :real_name=>"Justin Redd", :role=>"MAKER"}.

Meanwhile, first_hash is {:user_name=>"lawrfran", :real_name=>"Francis Lawrence", :role=>"MAKER"}.
I've just changed player two's hash to BREAKER. See for yourself : {:user_name=>"reddjust", :real_name=>"Justin Redd", :role=>"BREAKER"}.
Now that we've finished a_d, the player_hash is {:user_name=>"reddjust", :real_name=>"Justin Redd", :role=>"BREAKER"}.
You didn't break it! Fail!
